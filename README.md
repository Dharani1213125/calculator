**🎯 Project Title:** Smart Flask Calculator

**📝 Description:**
Smart Flask Calculator is a responsive and colorful 🌈 web-based calculator application developed using Python's Flask 🐍 framework. It allows users to perform both basic arithmetic ➕➖✖️➗ and advanced scientific 🔬 calculations through a user-friendly interface. The application features a clean UI with buttons for digits, basic operators, and toggleable scientific functions.

**✨ Key Features:**
- 🧮 Perform arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), modulus (%), floor division (//)
- 🔢 Scientific calculations: sine (sin), cosine (cos), tangent (tan), logarithm (log), square root (√), exponential (exp), and constants like π
- 📐 Trigonometric functions work with input in degrees
- 🧠 Toggleable scientific calculator panel
- 🕓 History display for the most recent calculation
- 🎨 Colorful and responsive UI design

**🛠️ Technology Stack:**
- 🖥️ Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- 🧪 Backend: Python, Flask

**🧰 Usage:**
Users can input expressions using on-screen buttons. When the "=" button is clicked, the expression is safely evaluated ✅, and the result is displayed. Scientific buttons can be shown or hidden using the "Sci" toggle.

**🎓 Educational Purpose:**
This project is ideal for students learning:
- 🌐 Web development with Flask
- 🔐 Safe expression evaluation using Python
- 🖼️ Creating interactive UIs using HTML/CSS and JS
